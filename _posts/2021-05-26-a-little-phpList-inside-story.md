While still a student, back in March 2019 I joined [phpList Ltd.](https://phplist.com/) in the role of the [Community Manager](https://www.phplist.org/mariana-phplists-new-community-manager) for the [phpList community](https://discuss.phplist.org/). I was so happy to join a group of people that had managed to develop and create such a great reputation for one of ‚Äúoldest‚Äù open source projects out there. Although I had a 3-year background into the "[Open Source Culture](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/open-source-culture)" world, day by day I was learning so much: new development terms, new system administration terms, new marketing & communications terms, etc. But the most important thing that I learned was what a ‚Äú**healthy work environment**‚Äù looks like. In a small team like phpList oftentimes you complete tasks that are not on your contract at the ‚Äújob description‚Äù section, but somehow it makes sense to try something new.

<i>A little phpList inside story</i>

Over these 2,5 years I have tried and experimented with several technologies and tools in order to make the team‚Äôs life easier and sometimes these efforts have failed. **Knowing that I have a manger that trusts me enough by allowing me to use company time to try things that are not guaranteed to have a direct monetary impact over time, boosted my confidence a lot and reduced work stress.** I know, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúresearch‚Äù and it is a normal operation in every company, but you don‚Äôt see people my age doing it.

A few days ago my manger [Michiel](https://github.com/michield) (and creator of [phpList](https://github.com/phpList)) shared with me a blogpost he had created around a programming topic and while I was browsing his blog I end up at the About page. There I read this:

My manger works full-time for another company and managing to find a workflow that suits everyone is one of the things that **I am so proud that everyone who has ever been involved with phpList managed to establish**. Not being physically at the same office, but instead being based across different timezones can be quite frustrating, especially for quick questions require confirmation from a team member. But, at phpList we have managed to overcome this. This contributes to creating a healthier work environment I mentioned above. By ‚Äúthis‚Äù I mean listening and tolerating the team/ company members‚Äô needs and ambitions.

**Over the course of 2,5 years I had the chance to meet and work with some very smart and talented people and what phpList is today is a result of their hard work.**

_PS: no, I am not leaving the company and this is not a farewell blogpost._ üòõ _I simply wanted to share that communicating effectively with your co-workers/ team members can lift a lot of pressure off their shoulders and make things work for the best for everyone._
