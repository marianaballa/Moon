Open Source Summit is a 3-day conference dedicated to the leading Open Source technologies, brought by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org). On August 2019 I joined Open Source Summit NA in San Diego, California and had three days full of open source.

My very first approach with Open Source Summit was back in October 2018 when I attended the European edition of the Summit in Edinburgh, Scotland. The NA 2019 edition of the conference was held at a coastal hotel by the San Diego Bay.
Same as the previous addition that I had attended in the past, Jim Zemlin held the first speech and welcomed everyone and briefly described the agenda for the upcoming days.

As I stated previously on the 1st paragraph of this blogpost, I had three days full of Open Source but definitely there were a few moments that made this experience memorable. 
* I had the chance to meet in person [Jono Bacon](https://www.jonobacon.com/), a veteran Community Manager in the open source industry. I have read his book [“The art of community”](https://www.jonobacon.com/books/) and I was very exited when I realized he is also attending the conference. Unfortunately, I missed his presentation (my jet lag had something to do with this....) but I joined a round-table discussion where I had the chance to talk in person and snap a picture.
* Another moment to be (definitely) remembered was Puppy Pawlooza. No this was not a session with a “catchy” title, it was actually a session when we could meet and greet actual puppies from a local dog shelter!! 

As a Fedora user and contributor, I found most Linux-related sessions very interesting. Although many of them were highly technical and beyond my knowledge, they made me realize that being in the tech industry was the right career path to take. All these amazing things people build that make our everyday life and business simpler and faster!

Overall, once again this was a great experience to have and I had the chance to attend again as a Diversity Scholar for my contributions in the open source ecosystem. I would like to thank the Linux Foundation for the Scholarship and the opportunity they gave myself and all these great people (whom I met in person during at the “Women in Open Source Lunch”) to attend and industry-great summit!
