[OSCAL (Open Source Conference Albania)](https://oscal.openlabs.cc/) is an annual conference in Albania organized to promote software freedom, open source software, free culture and open knowledge. The 2019 edition was the 6th  edition of the conference. The venue this year was [OFIÇINA](http://www.oficina.al/), a tech incubator.

Once again, the [Fedora Project](https://start.fedoraproject.org/) was there with an infobooth, with presentations, a Release Party and a generous sponsorship towards the event. On the first day in the morning, together with [Amita Sharma](https://twitter.com/AmitaSharma6) and [Adam Šamalík](https://twitter.com/adsamalik) we set up the booth with our swag near the openSUSE booth. We had Fedora <3 Python leaflets, different stickers, pens, booklets, and of course the two roll-up we’ve had the previous years and our tablecloth. As always the first day in the morning is busier as people are curious to learn what the project is about.

On the first day, Adam had his first session titled “Linux distributions, lifecycles, and containers”. Adam deferred to Fedora Modularity - a project bringing multiple versions of packages in Fedora with the qualities expected from a Linux distribution. He also had a second session before the closing speech on Sunday, the “slideshow karaoke”. An entertaining session where he invited on stage people to talk about random slides he had prepared in advance.

On the other hand, Amita had three different sessions. Her session on the first day, “Quality is everyone's responsibility” talking about quality assurance, her field of expertise in [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en). The second one was “Unexpectedly Agile”, where she talked about Agile documentation and open source project management tools for Agile teams. The third session was “Fedora for everyone”. This session was included within the Release Party.

On the second day of the conference we had our **[Fedora 30](https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-30/) Release Party**. At the very first part, Amita shared a general overview on the Fedora Project at her talk “Fedora for everyone” - she explained the different aspects of the Projects, how to be part of it no matter what background someone has (technical or non-technical) and shared her own experience as part of the Fedora Diversity & Inclusion group. After this wide introduction, it was my turn to talk about the new features of Fedora 30 and how to upgrade from an older version. Also we mentioned the new features of the GNOME 3,32, the latest version of the Fedora default desktop environment. At the end, we had cup cakes for all participants.

OSCAL is the main reason why I joined the Fedora community from the first place, as it was the interaction with Fedorians who welcomed me at the Project. It has been 3 years since then and I am very happy to see the Fedora Project there with representatives and a Silver Sponsorship!
