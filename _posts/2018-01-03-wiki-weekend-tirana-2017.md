During the second weekend of December I had the chance to be part of Wiki Weekend Tirana 2017. It was the second time I was able to join the event. Last year I was just an attendee, while this year I had a talk about all the Wikimedia projects.

Wiki Weekend Tirana is an event which is being organized for four years in a row and brings together old Wikimedians and new contributors. This year, the event was organized by some of the members of the newest Wikimedia User Group in Albania. Venue of Wiki Weekend was Open Labs Hackerspace. Open Labs is a local FLOSS community in the country. Open Labs hosts many Open Source projects, including Wikimedia.

The focus of my talk was not only one particular Wikimedia sub-project, but an overview of all of them. I shared with the participants info about these sub-projects and revealed how to contribute and be part of the communities. To my surprise most of the participants knew only the Wikipedia project.

During the 2-days event more than 200 new articles were created on the SQ Wikipedia. Also, all the pictures that were taken during the event were uploaded later on Commons. Looking forward to more events that newest User Group in Albania will organize. ðŸ˜„
