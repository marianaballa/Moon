Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is Mariana Balla, but I guess you already know that since you are here...

I own a Bachelor's degree on "Information & Communication Technology" granted by the [Faculty of Natural Sciences](http://www.fshn.edu.al/), University of Tirana and now I'm having my Master's based on the same subject at the same university. Alongside with my studies I work as an operations manager for [Ura Design](https://ura.design/), a design studio.

I'm passionate about free and open source technologies. For the past two years I've been a member of [Open Labs Hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc/en/) and since November 2017 I am also a member of the executive board. I'm sure you've never heard of a hackerspace's executive board that all members are girls! Have you? ðŸ˜‰ 

I've contributed to several FLOSS projects, such is [The Fedora Project](https://getfedora.org/), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/41.174/20.181) and [Wikimedia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Community_User_Group_Albania). Since August of 2017, I am Fedora Ambassador. Aside to the Fedora Project, I've been also contributing to Wikimedia's subprojects. Two other open source projects that I am heavily involved are the CityZen app and Identihub. [CityZen](http://cityzenapp.co/) is an Android app based on OpenStreetMap which helps you find Points of Interest (POIs) around the city without tracking your moves. I contribute to the marketing group. [Identihub](https://identihub.co/) is an open source software in which you can host your brands visual assets.
