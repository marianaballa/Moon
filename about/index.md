Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is Mariana Balla, but I guess you already know that since you are here...

I own a Bachelor's & a Master's degree on "Information & Communication Technology", both granted by the [Faculty of Natural Sciences](http://www.fshn.edu.al/), University of Tirana. 

Currently employed at [phpList Ltd.](https://www.phplist.com/) as a Product Owner. [phpList](https://www.phplist.org/) is an open source email marketing software initially launched back in 2001. 

I've contributed to several FLOSS projects, such is [The Fedora Project](https://getfedora.org/) & [Wikimedia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Community_User_Group_Albania).

I am a [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) geek ðŸŽŠ and for the past years I've been a member of [Open Labs Hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc/en/). Open Labs is probably the only hackerpsace with a majority of women joining. I'm sure you've never heard of a [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace)'s executive board that all members are girls! Have you? ðŸ˜‰ 

_A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, hackspace, or makerspace) is a **community-operated**, often "not for profit", workspace where people with common interests, such as **computers, machining, technology, science, digital art, or electronic art, can meet, socialize, and collaborate**. Hackerspaces are comparable to other community-operated spaces with similar aims and mechanisms such as Fab Lab, men's sheds, and commercial "for-profit" companies. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace)_
