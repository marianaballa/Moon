Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is Mariana Balla, but I guess you already know that since you are hereâ€¦

I study Information and Communication Technology at the Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tirana. Currently Iâ€™m based in Tirana, Albania.

Iâ€™m passionate about free and open source technologies. For the past two years Iâ€™ve been a member of Open Labs Hackerspace.

Iâ€™ve contributed to several FLOSS projects, such The Fedora Project, OpenStreetMap and Wikimedia. Since August of 2017, I am Fedora Ambassador. Aside to the Fedora Project, Iâ€™ve been also contributing to Wikimediaâ€™s subprojects.
