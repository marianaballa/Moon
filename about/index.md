Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is Mariana Balla, but I guess you already know that since you are here...

I study Information and Communication Technology at the [Faculty of Natural Sciences](http://www.fshn.edu.al/), University of Tirana. Currently I'm based in Tirana, Albania.

I'm passionate about free and open source technologies. For the past two years I've been a member of [Open Labs Hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc/en/) and since last November I am a board member. All board members are girls! 

I've contributed to several FLOSS projects, such [The Fedora Project](https://getfedora.org/), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/41.174/20.181) and [Wikimedia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Community_User_Group_Albania). Since August of 2017, I am Fedora Ambassador. Aside to the Fedora Project, I've been also contributing to Wikimedia's subprojects. Two other open source projects that I am heavily involved are the CityZen app and Identihub. [CityZen](http://cityzenapp.co/) is an Android app based on OpenStreetMap which helps you find Points of Interest (POIs) around the city without tracking your moves. I contribute to the marketing group. [Identihub](https://identihub.co/) is an open source software in which you can host your brands visual assets.
